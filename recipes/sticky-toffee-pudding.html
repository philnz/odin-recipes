        <h2>Sticky toffee pudding is a classic British dessert that's easier to make than you think. Serve warm with cream, ice cream, or custard for a delicious, crowd-pleasing dessert. The sponge cake includes finely chopped dates which make it super moist but it doesn't taste of dates at all!</h2>
